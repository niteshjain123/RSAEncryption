# RSA Encryption
The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) is a government initiative that aims to develop a digital health infrastructure for India. An overview of ABDM can be found [here](https://github.com/NHA-ABDM/ABDM-wrapper/wiki/ABDM-Overview). The ABDM aims to improve the efficiency and transparency of healthcare data transfer between patients, medical institutions, and healthcare service providers. It also allows patients to securely store their medical information and share with others as needed.
The National Health Authority (NHA) is implementing Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) to create a digital health ecosystem for the country. ABDM intends to support different healthcare facilities like clinics, diagnostic centers, hospitals, laboratories and pharmacies in adopting the ABDM ecosystem to make available the benefits of digital health for all the citizens of India.
In order to make any digital solution ABDM compliant, it has to go through 3 milestones and obtain AND certification.
- Milestone 1: ABHA Id creation, verification
- Milestone 2: Linking and exporting health data
- Milestone 3: Sending a consent request and importing data from other applications in the ecosystem

RSA Encryption is created to solve the challenges and issues faced by integrators to bring their systems into ABDM ecosystem.
